# ðŸŽ® Battleship #
For our final project for Grade 12 Computer Science, we made a game of battleship a player can go against an AI.

# ðŸ§© Features #
- Battleship includes an easy, medium and hard mode with different grid sizes to make guessing harder.
- The AI plays with a similar style as a human, where it makes guesses around a target until it fully sinks the ship.
- There is a timer which tracks your total time it takes to beat the game.
- At the end of the game, your highscore, win loss ratio and time is displayed.
